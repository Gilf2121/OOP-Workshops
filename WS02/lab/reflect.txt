The topics that i learned/used in completing this workshop were; C++ types such as bools,
compound types such as structs, dynamic memory allocation and deletion, and scopes.
In c++ Bool types are equal to either 0 which means false, or 1 (or more) meaning true.
Bools are very useful for flags since they only have a true/false value, even though they can
be set as differnt numbers. Another topic i learned about is scopes. Scope refers to wether
a variable or object is visible to the program. A variable that is in main can be used by a 
function under main, however any variables declared in the subfunction will not be available
to use in main since they are out of scope. Likewise any variables from main used in the 
subfunction will be shadowed, and therefore not actually be changed in the main function.
Lastly, in this workshop i learned about dynamic memory allocation/deallocation and how to create
memory for a variable with the "new" keyword, and how to delete the memory and the pointer to it
with the "delete" keyword.
