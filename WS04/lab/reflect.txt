I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code that my professor provided to complete my workshops and assignments.



During this workshop some of the concepts that i learned and used include Constructors, Overloading,
Query methods, Modifier methods, and special methods. I created different types of methods to
Modify data from objects, read data from objects,and create objects. I also used overloading to
create multiple functions with the same name, but different parameters in order to make sure
the correct function is being used without needing to manually call it for each instance.

Another concept that i used in this workshop is the "this" keyword. The "this" keyword contains 
the address to the current object. In my workshop the "this" keyword is used to return the 
address of the object that has just been modified.
