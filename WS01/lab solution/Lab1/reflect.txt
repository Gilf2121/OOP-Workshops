the topics i have learned in completing this workshop are; namespaces, and using the solution explorer.
Namespaces assist with collaboration in large teams by allowing multiple functions to have the same name.
Functions with the same name must be defined in seperate namespaces and for a function to be used it must be called in its namespace.
Even though functions can only have one defenition they can have multiple declerations.
Another topic that i learned about from this workshop is the 'auto' keyword. 
The auto keyword can be used to define a variable without a set type, however the variable must have a value when it is used with the auto keyword.
With this workshop i did not have much difficulty.
